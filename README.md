# What Should I Drink? 

# The problem: 
There are so many great craft beers out there and sometimes it's difficult to find the right one. 

# The solution:

What Should I Drink? is a ASP.NET Core application with identity framework that queries a database of beers based on the time of year a beer is available, the type of night the drinker is looking to have and how they're feeling. 

I correlated the type of night with different levels of ABV (alcohol by volume) and I correlated how a user is feeling with different styles of beer. 

In addition to being able to find a beer by these criteria, a user can also select a beer based on just one of the above. 

Users can also log in and keep a list of the beers they want to remember along with being able to add beers to the database to make an even better drinking experience.
